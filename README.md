# FacialRecognitionAttendanceSystem
This project is a facial recognition-based attendance system designed to automate clock-ins and clock-outs in schools and workplaces. Built with Python in a Kaggle notebook, the system uses face detection models (Haar cascades and OpenCV DNN) to detect users, records attendance in an SQLite database, and enforces lateness penalties.
